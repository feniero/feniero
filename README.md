# Hi there 👋

I'm a Cloud SaaS IT Systemist with a strong passion for **critical thinking, finance, mathematics, and emerging technologies**.  
I'm also a big fan of **open-source software** and the collaborative spirit behind it.

This GitHub space is my playground: a place to experiment, try out ideas, and share what I build; it may help someone else 🚀
